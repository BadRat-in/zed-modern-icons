**Modern, theme-aware SVG icon set for the Zed editor.**

This package provides a clean and minimal icon system for file types and technologies, optimized for light and dark themes.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìÅ File-type and tech stack icons (e.g. JS, TS, Rust, Python, HTML, CSS, etc.)
- üåó Automatically adapts to Zed's light and dark themes
- üß© Easy integration into Zed extensions or custom UI elements
- üé® Pixel-perfect vector design

## üìÅ File Naming Convention

Each icon has two variants:

- `file_type_light_{{TYPE}}.svg` ‚Äî for light theme
- `file_type_{{TYPE}}.dark.svg` ‚Äî for dark theme

Use the appropriate one based on the current theme.

## üì¶ Installation

1. Open Zed Editor
2. Press `cmd+shift+p` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+p` (Linux/Windows)
3. Type "zed: extensions" and select it
4. Search for "Modern Icons Theme"
5. Click "Install"

Alternatively, you can install from the command line:
```bash
zed --install-extension modern-icons
```

## üì∏ Previews

<img src="./previews/light.png" alt="Light Theme" width="200"/>
<img src="./previews/dark.png" alt="Dark Theme" width="200"/>

## üåì Automatic Theme Detection

This extension is theme-aware, but Zed doesn't automatically switch between the light and dark themes by default. You'll need to manually select the appropriate theme ("Modern Icons (Light)" or "Modern Icons (Dark)") when you change Zed's theme.

For automatic theme switching based on your system's appearance, you can add the following configuration to your Zed `settings.json` file. This will sync both your Zed UI theme and the icon theme with your system settings.

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "light": "Your Light Theme Name",
    "dark": "Your Dark Theme Name"
  },
  "icon_theme": {
    "light": "Modern Icons (Light)",
    "dark": "Modern Icons (Dark)"
  }
}
```

_(Replace `"Your Light Theme Name"` and `"Your Dark Theme Name"` with the names of your preferred themes.)_
